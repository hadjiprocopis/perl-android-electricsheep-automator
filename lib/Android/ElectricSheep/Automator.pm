# If 'lazy'==0, then for each installed app the device will be enquired
# and an AppProperties object will be created (it contains MainActivity,
# Permissions, etc.) and set as the value in the apps HASH.
# If 'packages' is specified and 'lazy'==0, then only those packages
# in 'packages' will be enquired, the $self->apps list will be
# refreshed with all the package names (key) but only some of them will
# contain an AppProperties object as the value, the other values
# will be undef.
# If no 'packages' was specified and 'lazy'==0, then all
# packages installed on device will be enquired and an AppProperties object
# will be associated with each of them in $self->apps.
# Default 'lazy' value is 1.
# Input:
#   'packages' => 'packagename' or regex (e.g. qr//) or [...] or { ...} :
#       optionally specify a list of package names to find ONLY,
#       default is to find ALL apps, which can be expensive if lazy>0
#       the 'packages' items can be a scalar string for exact match
#       or a compiled regex (qr//)
#   'force-reload-apps-list' => 0 or 1 : if 1, erase current list and start afresh
#   'lazy' => 1 or 0 : optionally specify not to enquire each package in detail,
#       i.e. creating an AppProperties object for each package,
#       but just add the package name as a key to the hash,
#       leaving the value undef. This value will be
#       created when needed, e.g. in an open_app() call.
#       Default is to be lazy, 1.
# It needs that connect_device() to have been called prior to this call
#
# On failure it returns undef.
# On success it saves the results in $self->apps HASH and returns that.
#
# NOTE: enquiring installed apps entails this:
#  1. adb shell dumpsys package packages
#     which is a general output of installed packages but does not contain
#     activity information.
#  2. For a given installed app name (package) we enquire by
#       adb shell dumpsys package com.example.myapp
#  WARNING: the 2nd step if called for all the installed apps can take some
#           time as it is done for each installed app.
#           Perhaps a better approach is to lazily find apps by
#           specifying the name of the app with the input parameter
#             'packages' => [...]
#           This will append to apps() the result.

=head1 NAME

Android::ElectricSheep::Automator - Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Smartphone control from your desktop.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.06

=head1 WARNING

Current distribution is extremely alpha. API may change. 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The present package fascilitates the control
of a USB-debugging-enabled
Android device, e.g. a real smartphone,
or an emulated (virtual) Android device,
from your desktop computer using Perl.
It's basically a thickishly-thin wrapper
to the omnipotent Android Debug Bridge (adb)
program.

B<Note that absolutely nothing is
installed on the connected device,
neither any of its settings will be modified by this package>.
See L</WILL ANYTHING BE INSTALLED ON THE DEVICE?>.

    use Android::ElectricSheep::Automator;

    my $mother = Android::ElectricSheep::Automator->new({
      # optional as there is a default, but you may have
      # problems with the location of the adb executable
      'configfile' => $configfile,
      'verbosity' => 1,
      # we already have a device connected and ready to control
      'device-is-connected' => 1,
    });

    # find the devices connected to desktop and set one.
    my @devices = $mother->adb->devices;
    $mother->connect_device({'serial' => $devices->[0]->serial})
	or die;
    # no device needs to be specified if just one:
    $mother->connect_device() if scalar(@devices)==0;

    # Go Home
    $mother->home_screen() or die;

    # swipe up/down/left/right
    $mother->swipe({'direction'=>up}) or die;
    # dt is the time to swipe in millis,
    # the shorter the faster the swipe
    $mother->swipe({'direction'=>left, 'dt'=>100}) or die;

    # tap
    $mother->tap({'position'=>[100,200]});

    # uses swipe() to move in screens (horizontally):
    $mother->next_screen() or die;
    $mother->previous_screen() or die;

    # bottom navigation:
    # the "triangle" back button
    $mother->navigation_menu_back_button() or die;
    # the "circle" home button
    $mother->navigation_menu_home_button() or die;
    # the "square" overview button
    $mother->navigation_menu_overview_button() or die;

    # open/close apps
    $mother->open_app({'package'=>qr/calendar$/i}) or die;
    $mother->close_app({'package'=>qr/calendar$/i}) or die;

    # push pull files

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 B<C<new($params)>>

Creates a new C<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator> object. C<$params>
is a hash reference used to pass initialization options which may
or should include the following:

=over 4

=item B<C<confighash>> or B<C<configfile>>

the configuration
file holds
configuration parameters. Its format is "enhanced" JSON
(see L<Config::JSON::Enhanced>) which is basically JSON
which allows comments between C< E<lt>/* > and C< */E<gt> >.

Here is an example configuration file to get you started:

  {
    "adb" : {
        "path-to-executable" : "/usr/local/android-sdk/platform-tools/adb"
    },
    "debug" : {
        "verbosity" : 0,
        </* cleanup temp files on exit */>
        "cleanup" : 1
    },
    "logger" : {
        </* log to file if you uncomment this, else console */>
        "filename" : "my.log"
    }
  }

All sections in the configuration are mandatory.
Setting C<"adb"> to the wrong path will yield problems.

C<confighash> is a hash of configuration options with
structure as above and can be supplied to the constructor
instead of the configuration file.

If no configuration is specified, then a default
configuration will be used. In this case please
specify B<C<adb-path-to-executable>> to point
to the location of C<adb>. Most likely
the default path will not work for you.

=item B<C<adb-path-to-executable>>

optionally specify the path to the C<adb> executable in
your desktop system. This will override the setting
C< 'adb'-E<gt>'path-to-executable' > in the configuration,
if it was provided. Use this option if you are not
providing any configuration and so the default configuration
will be used. But it will most likely fail because of this
path not being correct for your system. So, if you are going
to omit providing a configuration and the default configuration
will be used do specify the C<adb> path via this option (but you
don't have to and your mileage may vary).

=item B<C<device-serial>> or B<C<device-object>>

optionally specify the serial
of a device to connect to on instantiation,
or a L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator::DeviceProperties>
object you already have handy. Alternatively,
use L</connect_device($params)> to set the connected device at a later
time. Note that there is no need to specify a
device if there is exactly one connected device.

=item B<C<adb>>

optionally specify an already created L<Android::ADB> object.
Otherwise, a fresh object will be created based
on the configuration under the C<adb> section of the configuration.

=item B<C<device-is-connected>>

optionally set it to 1
in order to communicate with the device
and get some information about it like
screen size, resolution, orientation, etc.
And also allow use of
functionality which needs communicating with a device
like L</swipe($params)>, L</home_screen($params)>,
L</open_app($params)>, etc.
After instantiation, you can use the
method L</connect_device($params)> and
L</disconnect_device()> for conveying
this information to the module.
Also note that if there are
more than one devices connected to the desktop, make sure
you specify which one with the C<device> parameter.
Default value is 0.

=item B<C<logger>>

optionally specify a logger object
to be used (instead of creating a fresh one). This object
must implement these methods: C<info()>, C<warn()>, C<error()>.
L<Mojo::Log> fits perfectly.

=item B<C<logfile>>

optionally specify a file to
save logging output to. This overrides the C<filename>
key under section C<logger> of the configuration.

=item B<C<verbosity>>

optionally specify a verbosity level
which will override what the configuration contains. Default
is C<0>.

=item B<C<cleanup>>

optionally specify a flag to clean up
any temp files after exit which will override what the
configuration contains. Default is C<1>, meaning Yes!.

=back

=head1 METHODS

Note:

=over 4

=item B<C<ARRAY_REF>> : C<my $ar = [1,2,3]; my $ar = \@ahash; my @anarray = @$ar;>

=item B<C<HASH_REF>> : C<my $hr = {1=>1, 2=>2}; my $hr = \%ahash; my %ahash = %$hr;>

=item In this module parameters to functions are passed as a HASH_REF.
Functions return back objects, ARRAY_REF or HASH_REF.

=back


=head2 B<C<devices()>>

Lists all Android devices connected to your
desktop and returns these as an ARRAY_REF which can be empty.

It returns C<undef> on failure.

=head2 B<C<connect_device($params)>>

Specifies the current Android device to control. Its use is
required only if you have more than one devices connected.
C<$params> is a HASH_REF which should contain exactly
one of the following:

=over 4

=item B<C<serial>> should contain
the serial (string) of the connected device as returned
by L</devices()>.

=item B<C<device-object>> should be
an already existing L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator::DeviceProperties>
object.

=back

It returns C<0> on success, C<1> on failure.

=head2 B<C<dump_current_screen_ui($params)>>

It dumps the current screen as XML and returns that as
a string, optionally saving it to the specified file.

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which may or should contain:

=over 4

=item B<C<filename>>

optionally save the returned XML string to the specified file.

=back

It returns C<undef> on failure or the UI XML dump, as a string, on success.

It dumps the current screen as a PNG image and returns that as
a L<Image::PNG> object, optionally saving it to the specified file.

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which may or should contain:

=over 4

=item B<C<filename>>

optionally save the returned XML string to the specified file.

=back

It returns C<undef> on failure or a L<Image::PNG> image, on success.

=head2 B<C<dump_current_screen_video($params)>>

It dumps the current screen as MP4 video and saves that
in specified file.

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which may or should contain:

=over 4

=item B<C<filename>>

save the recorded video to the specified file in MP4 format. This
is required.

=item B<C<time-limit>>

optionally specify the duration of the recorded video, in seconds. Default is 10 seconds.

=item B<C<bit-rate>>

optionally specify the bit rate of the recorded video in bits per second. Default is 20Mbps.

# Optionally specify %size = ('width' => ..., 'height' => ...)

=item B<C<size>>

optionally specify the size (geometry) of the recorded video as a
HASH_REF with keys C<width> and C<height>, in pixels. Default is "I<the
device's main display resolution>".

=item B<C<bugreport>>

optionally set this flag to 1 to have Android overlay debug information
on the recorded video, e.g. timestamp.

# Optionally specify 'display-id'.
=item B<C<display-id>>

for a device set up with multiple physical displays, optionally
specify which one to record -- if not the main display -- by providing the
display id. You can find display ids with L</list_physical_displays()>
or, from the CLI, by C<adb shell dumpsys SurfaceFlinger --display-id>

=back

C<adb shell screenrecord --help> contains some more documentation.

=head2 B<C<list_physical_displays()>>

It lists the IDs of all the physical displays connected to the
device, including the main one and returns these back as a HASH_REF
keyed on display ID. It needs that connect_device() to have been called prior to this call

It returns C<undef> on failure or the results as a HASH_REF keyed on display ID.

=head2 B<C<list_running_processes($params)>>

It finds the running processes on device (using a `ps`),
optionally can save the (parsed) `ps`
results as JSON to the specified 'filename'.
It returns C<undef> on failure or the results as a hash of hashes on success.

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which may or should contain:

=over 4

=item B<C<extra-fields>>

=over 4

=item B<C<raw>> : contains the raw `ps` output as a string.

=item B<C<perl>> : contains the parsed raw output as a Perl hash with
each item corresponding to one process, keyed on process command and arguments
(as reported by `ps`, verbatim), as a hash keyed on each field (column)
of the `ps` output.

=item B<C<json>> : the above data converted into a JSON string.

=back

=head2 B<C<pidof($params)>>

name exactly. B<Use L/pgrep()> if you want to match command
names with a regular expression>.

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which should contain:

=over 4

=item B<C<name>>

the name of the process. It can be a command name,
e.g. C<audioserver> or an app name e.g. C<android.hardware.vibrator-service.example>.

=back

It returns C<undef> on failure or the PID of the matched command on success.


=head2 B<C<pgrep($params)>>

It returns the PIDs matching the specified command or app
name (which can be an extended regular expression that C<pgrep>
understands). The returned array will contain zero, one or more
hashes with keys C<pid> and C<command>. The former key is the pid of the command
whose full name (as per the process table) will be under the latter key.
Unless parameter C<dont-show-command-name> was set to C<1>.

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which should contain:

=over 4

=item B<C<name>>

the name of the process. It can be a command name,
e.g. C<audioserver> or an app name e.g. C<android.hardware.vibrator-service.example>
or part of these e.g. C<audio> or C<hardware> or an extended
regular expression that Android's C<pgrep> understands, e.g.
C<^com.+google.+mess>.

=back

It returns C<undef> on failure or an ARRAY_REF containing
a HASH_REF of data for each command matched (under keys C<pid> and C<command>).
The returned ARRAY_REF can contain 0, 1 or more items depending
on what was matched.


=head2 B<C<geofix($params)>>

It fixes the geolocation of the device to the specified coordinates.
After this, app API calls to get current geolocation will result to this
position (unless they use their own, roundabout way).

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which should contain:

=over 4

=item B<C<latitude>>

the latitude of the position as a floating point number.

=item B<C<longitude>>

the longitude of the position as a floating point number.

=back

It returns C<1> on failure or a C<0> on success.

=head2 B<C<dump_current_location()>>

It finds the current GPS location of the device
according to ALL the GPS providers available.

It needs that connect_device() to have been called prior to this call

It takes no parameters.

On failure, it returns C<undef>.

On success, it returns a HASH_REF of results.
Each item will be keyed on provider name (e.g. 'C<network provider>')
and will contain the parsed output of
what each GPS provider returned as a HASH_REF with
the following keys:

=over 4

=item B<C<provider>> : the provider name. This is also the key of the item
in the parent hash.

=item B<C<latitude>> : the latitude as a floating point number (can be negative too)
or C< E<lt>naE<gt> > if the provider failed to return valid output.

=item B<C<longitude>> : the longitude as a floating point number (can be negative too)
or C< E<lt>na E<gt> > if the provider failed to return valid output.

=item B<C<last-location-string>> : the last location string, or
C< E<lt>na E<gt> > if the provider failed to return valid output.

=back

=head2 B<C<is_app_running($params)>>

It checks if the specified app is running on the device.
The name of the app must be exact.
Note that you can search for running apps / commands
with extended regular expressions using L/pgrep()>

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which should contain:

=over 4

=item B<C<appname>>

the name of the app to check if it is running.
It must be its exact name. Basically it checks the
output of L<pidof()>.

=back

It returns C<undef> on failure,
C<1> if the app is running or C<0> if the app is not running.

=head2 B<C<find_current_device_properties($params)>>

It enquires the device currently connected,
and specified with L</connect_device($params)>, if needed,
and returns back an L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator::DeviceProperties>
object containing this information, for example screen size,
resolution, serial number, etc.

It returns L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator::DeviceProperties>
object on success or C<undef> on failure.

=head2 B<C<connect_device()>>

It signals to our object that there is now
a device connected to the desktop and its
enquiry and subsequent control can commence.
If this is not called and neither C<device-is-connected =E<gt> 1>
is specified as a parameter to the constructor, then
the functionality will be limited and access
to functions like L</swipe($params)>, L</open_app($params)>, etc.
will be blocked until the caller signals that
a device is now connected to the desktop.

Using L</connect_device($params)> to specify which device
to target in the case of multiple devices
connected to the desktop will also call this
method.

This method will try to enquire the connected device
about some of its properties, like screen size,
resolution, orientation, serial number etc.
This information will subsequently be available
via C<$self-E<gt>>device_properties()>.

It returns C<0> on success, C<1> on failure.

=head2 B<C<disconnect_device()>>

Signals to our object that it should consider
that there is currently no device connected to
the desktop (irrespective of that is true or not)
which will block access to L</swipe($params)>, L</open_app($params)>, etc.

=head2 B<C<device_properties()>>

It returns the currently connected device properties
as a L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator::DeviceProperties>
object or C<undef> if there is no connected device.
The returned object is constructed during a call
to L</find_current_device_properties($params)>
which is called via L</connect_device($params)> and will persist
for the duration of the connection.
However, after a call to L</disconnect_device()>
this object will be discarded and C<undef> will be
returned.

=head2 B<C<swipe($params)>>

Emulates a "swipe" in four directions.
Sets the current Android device to control. It is only
required if you have more than one device connected.
C<$params> is a HASH_REF which may or should contain:

=over 4

=item B<C<direction>>

should be one of

=over 4

=item up

=item down

=item left

=item right

=back

=item B<C<dt>>

denotes the time taken for the swipe
in milliseconds. The smaller its value the faster
the swipe. A value of C<100> is fast enough to swipe to
the next screen.

=back

It returns C<0> on success, C<1> on failure.

=head2 B<C<tap($params)>>

Emulates a "tap" at the specified location.
C<$params> is a HASH_REF which must contain one
of the following items:

=over 4

=item B<C<position>>

should be an ARRAY_REF
as the C<X,Y> coordinates of the point to "tap".

=item B<C<bounds>>

should be an ARRAY_REF of a bounding rectangle
of the widget to tap. Which contains two ARRAY_REFs
for the top-left and bottom-right coordinates, e.g.
C< [ [tlX,tlY], [brX,brY] ] >. This is convenient
when the widget is extracted from an XML dump of
the UI (see L</dump_current_screen_ui($params)>) which
contains exactly this bounding rectangle.

=back

It returns C<0> on success, C<1> on failure.

=head2 B<C<input_text($params)>>

It "C<types>" the specified text into the specified position,
where a text-input widget is expected to exist.
At first it taps at the widget's
location in order to get the focus. And then it enters
the text. You need to find the position of the desired
text-input widget by first getting the current screen UI
(using L</dump_current_screen_ui($params)>) and then using an XPath
selector to identify the desired widget by name/id/attributes.
See the source code of method L</send_message()> in file
C<lib/Android/ElectricSheep/Automator/Plugins/Apps/Viber.pm>
for how this is done for the message-sending text-input widget
of the Viber app.

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which must contain C<text>
and one of the two position (of the text-edit widget)
specifiers C<position> or C<bounds>:

=over 4

=item B<C<text>>

the text to write on the text edit widget. At the
moment, this must be plain ASCII string, not unicode.
No spaces are accepted.
Each space character must be replaced with C<%s>.

=item B<C<position>>

should be an ARRAY_REF
as the C<X,Y> coordinates of the point to "tap" in order
to get the focus of the text edit widget, preceding the
text input.

=item B<C<bounds>>

should be an ARRAY_REF of a bounding rectangle
of the widget to tap, in order to get the focus, preceding
the text input. Which contains two ARRAY_REFs
for the top-left and bottom-right coordinates, e.g.
C< [ [tlX,tlY], [brX,brY] ] >. This is convenient
when the widget is extracted from an XML dump of
the UI (see L</dump_current_screen_ui($params)>) which
contains exactly this bounding rectangle.

=back

It returns C<0> on success, C<1> on failure.

=head2 B<C<clear_input_field($params)>>

It clears the contents of a text-input widget
at specified location.

There are several ways to do this. The simplest way
(with C<keycombination>) does not work in some
devices, in which case a failsafe way is employed
which deletes characters one after the other for
250 times. 

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which must contain
one of the two position (of the text-edit widget)
specifiers C<position> or C<bounds>:

=over 4

=item <B<C<position>>

should be an ARRAY_REF
as the C<X,Y> coordinates of the point to "tap" in order
to get the focus of the text edit widget, preceding the
text input.

=item B<C<bounds>>

should be an ARRAY_REF of a bounding rectangle
of the widget to tap, in order to get the focus, preceding
the text input. Which contains two ARRAY_REFs
for the top-left and bottom-right coordinates, e.g.
C< [ [tlX,tlY], [brX,brY] ] >. This is convenient
when the widget is extracted from an XML dump of
the UI (see L</dump_current_screen_ui($params)>) which
contains exactly this bounding rectangle.

=item B<C<num-characters>>

how many times to press the backspace? Default is 250!
But if you know the length of the text currently at
the text-edit widget then enter this here.

=back

It returns C<0> on success, C<1> on failure.

=head2 B<C<home_screen()>>

Go to the "home" screen.

It returns C<0> on success, C<1> on failure.


=head2 B<C<wake_up()>>

"Wake" up the device.

It returns C<0> on success, C<1> on failure.


=head2 B<C<next_screen()>>

Swipe to the next screen (on the right).

It returns C<0> on success, C<1> on failure.


=head2 B<C<previous_screen()>>

Swipe to the previous screen (on the left).

It returns C<0> on success, C<1> on failure.


=head2 B<C<navigation_menu_back_button()>>

Press the "back" button which is the triangular
button at the left of the navigation menu at the bottom.

It returns C<0> on success, C<1> on failure.

=head2 B<C<navigation_menu_home_button()>>

Press the "home" button which is the circular
button in the middle of the navigation menu at the bottom.

It returns C<0> on success, C<1> on failure.

=head2 B<C<navigation_menu_overview_button()>>

Press the "overview" button which is the square
button at the right of the navigation menu at the bottom.

It returns C<0> on success, C<1> on failure.

=head2 B<C<apps()>>

It returns a HASH_REF containing all the
packages (apps) installed on the device
keyed on package name (which is like C<com.android.settings>.
The list of installed apps is populated either
if C<device-is-connected> is set to 1 during construction
or a call has been made to any of these
methods: L</open_app($params)>, L</close_app($params)>,
L</search_app($params)>, L</find_installed_apps($params)>.

=head2 B<C<find_installed_apps($params)>>

It enquires the device about all the installed
packages (apps) it has for the purpose of
opening and closing apps with L</open_app($params)> and L</close_app($params)>.
This list is available using C<$self->apps> (where C<$self>
is a L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator> object.

Finding the package names is done in a single
operation and does
not take long. But enquiring with the connected device
about the main activity/ies
of each package takes some time as there should be
one enquiry for each package. By default,
L</find_installed_apps($params)> will find all the package names
but will not enquire each package (fast).
This enquiry will be
done lazily if and when you need to open or close that
app.

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which may or should contain:

=over 4

=item B<C<packages>>

is a list of package names to enquire
about with the device. It can be a scalar string with the
exact package name, e.g. C<com.android.settings>, or
a L<Regexp> object which is a compiled regular expression
created by e.g. C<qr/^\.com.+?\.settings$/i>, or
an ARRAY_REF of package names. Or a HASH_REF where
keys are package names. For each of the packages matched
witht this specification a full enquiry will be made
with the connected device. The information will
be saved in a L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator::AppProperties>
object and will include the main activity/ies, permissions requested etc.

=item B<C<lazy>>

is a flag to denote whether to enquire
information about each package (app) at the time of this
call (set it to C<1>) or lazily, on a if-and-when-needed basis
(set it to C<0> which is the default). C<lazy> affects
all packages except those specified in C<packages>, if any.
Default is C<1>.

=item B<C<force-reload-apps-list'>>

can be set to 1 to
erase previous packages information and start fresh.
Default is C<0>.

=back

It returns a HASH_REF of packages names (keys) along
with enquired information (as a L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator::AppProperties>
object) or C<undef> if this information was not
obtained (e.g. when C<lazy> is set to 1).
It also sets the exact same data to be available
via C<$self->apps>.

=head2 B<C<search_app($params)>>

It searches the list of installed packages (apps)
on the current device and returns the match(es)
as a HASH_REF keyed on package name which may
have as values L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator::AppProperties>
objects with packages information. If there are
no entries yet in the list of installed packages,
it calls the L</find_installed_apps($params)> first to populate it.

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which may or should contain:

=over 4

=item B<C<package>>

is required. It can either be
a scalar string with the exact package name
or a L<Regexp> object which is a compiled regular expression
created by e.g. C<qr/^\.com.+?\.settings$/i>.

=item B<C<lazy>>

is a flag to be passed on to L</find_installed_apps($params)>,
if needed, to denote whether to enquire
information about each package (app) at the time of this
call (set it to C<1>) or lazily, on a if-and-when-needed basis
(set it to C<0> which is the default). C<lazy> affects
all packages except those specified in C<packages>, if any. Default is C<1>.

=item B<C<force-reload-apps-list'>>

is a flag to be passed on to L</find_installed_apps($params)>,
if needed, and can be set to 1 to
erase previous packages information and start fresh. Default is C<0>.

=back

It returns a HASH_REF of matched packages names (keys) along
with enquired information (as a L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator::AppProperties>
object) or C<undef> if this information was not
obtained (e.g. when C<lazy> is set to 1).

=head2 B<C<open_app($params)>>

It opens the package specified in C<$params>
on the current device. If there are
no entries yet in the list of installed packages,
it calls the L</find_installed_apps($params)> first to populate it.
It will refuse to open multiple apps matched perhaps
by a regular expression in the package specification.

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which may or should contain:

=over 4

=item B<C<package>>

is required. It can either be
a scalar string with the exact package name
or a L<Regexp> object which is a compiled regular expression
created by e.g. C<qr/^\.com.+?\.settings$/i>. If a regular
expression, the call will fail if there is not
exactly one match.

=item B<C<lazy>>

is a flag to be passed on to L</find_installed_apps($params)>,
if needed, to denote whether to enquire
information about each package (app) at the time of this
call (set it to C<1>) or lazily, on a if-and-when-needed basis
(set it to C<0> which is the default). C<lazy> affects
all packages except those specified in C<packages>, if any. Default is C<1>.

=item B<C<force-reload-apps-list>>

is a flag to be passed on to L</find_installed_apps($params)>,
if needed, and can be set to 1 to
erase previous packages information and start fresh. Default is C<0>.

=back

It returns a HASH_REF of matched packages names (keys) along
with enquired information (as a L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator::AppProperties>
object). At the moment, because L</open_app($params)> allows opening only a single app,
this hash will contain only one entry unless we allow opening multiple
apps (e.g. via a regex which it is already supported) in the future.

=head2 B<C<close_app($params)>>

It closes the package specified in C<$params>
on the current device. If there are
no entries yet in the list of installed packages,
it calls the L</find_installed_apps($params)> first to populate it.
It will refuse to close multiple apps matched perhaps
by a regular expression in the package specification.

C<$params> is a HASH_REF which may or should contain:

=over 4

=item B<C<package>>

is required. It can either be
a scalar string with the exact package name
or a L<Regexp> object which is a compiled regular expression
created by e.g. C<qr/^\.com.+?\.settings$/i>. If a regular
expression, the call will fail if there is not
exactly one match.

=item B<C<lazy>>

is a flag to be passed on to L</find_installed_apps($params)>,
if needed, to denote whether to enquire
information about each package (app) at the time of this
call (set it to C<1>) or lazily, on a if-and-when-needed basis
(set it to C<0> which is the default). C<lazy> affects
all packages except those specified in C<packages>, if any. Default is C<1>.

=item B<C<force-reload-apps-list>>

is a flag to be passed on to L</find_installed_apps($params)>,
if needed, and can be set to 1 to
erase previous packages information and start fresh. Default is C<0>.

=back

It returns a HASH_REF of matched packages names (keys) along
with enquired information (as a L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator::AppProperties>
object). At the moment, because L</close_app($params)> allows closing only a single app,
this hash will contain only one entry unless we allow closing multiple
apps (e.g. via a regex which it is already supported) in the future.


=head1 SCRIPTS

For convenience, a few simple scripts are provided:

=head2 B<C<script/electric-sheep-find-installed-apps.pl>>

Find all install packages in the connected device. E.g.

C<< script/electric-sheep-find-installed-apps.pl --configfile config/myapp.conf --device Pixel_2_API_30_x86_ --output myapps.json >>

C<< script/electric-sheep-find-installed-apps.pl --configfile config/myapp.conf --device Pixel_2_API_30_x86_ --output myapps.json --fast >>


=head2 B<C<script/electric-sheep-open-app.pl>>

Open an app by its exact name or a keyword matching it (uniquely):

C<< script/electric-sheep-open-app.pl --configfile config/myapp.conf --name com.android.settings >>

C<< script/electric-sheep-open-app.pl --configfile config/myapp.conf --keyword 'clock' >>

Note that it constructs a regular expression from escaped user input.

=head2 B<C<script/electric-sheep-close-app.pl>>

Close an app by its exact name or a keyword matching it (uniquely):

C<< script/electric-sheep-close-app.pl --configfile config/myapp.conf --name com.android.settings >>

C<< script/electric-sheep-close-app.pl --configfile config/myapp.conf --keyword 'clock' >>

Note that it constructs a regular expression from escaped user input.

=head2 B<C<script/electric-sheep-dump-ui.pl>>

Dump the current screen UI as XML to STDOUT or to a file:

C<< script/electric-sheep-dump-ui.pl --configfile config/myapp.conf --output ui.xml >>

Note that it constructs a regular expression from escaped user input.

=head2 B<C<script/electric-sheep-dump-current-location.pl>>

Dump the GPS / geo-location position for the device from its various providers, if enabled.

C<< script/electric-sheep-dump-current-location.pl --configfile config/myapp.conf --output geolocation.json >>

=head2 B<C<script/electric-sheep-emulator-geofix.pl>>

Set the GPS / geo-location position to the specified coordinates.

C<< script/electric-sheep-dump-ui.pl --configfile config/myapp.conf --latitude 12.3 --longitude 45.6 >>

=head2 B<C<script/electric-sheep-dump-screen-shot.pl>>

Take a screenshot of the device (current screen) and save to a PNG file.

C<< script/electric-sheep-dump-screen-shot.pl --configfile config/myapp.conf --output screenshot.png >>

=head2 B<C<script/electric-sheep-dump-screen-video.pl>>

Record a video of the device's current screen and save to an MP4 file.

C<< script/electric-sheep-dump-screen-video.pl --configfile config/myapp.conf --output video.mp4 --time-limit 30 >>

=head2 B<C<script/electric-sheep-viber-send-message.pl>>

Send a message using the Viber app.

C<< script/electric-sheep-viber-send-message.pl --message 'hello%sthere' --recipient 'george' --configfile config/myapp.conf --device Pixel_2_API_30_x86_ >>

This one saves a lot of debugging information to C<debug> which can be used to
deal with special cases or different versions of Viber:

C<< script/electric-sheep-viber-send-message.pl --outbase debug --verbosity 1 --message 'hello%sthere' --recipient 'george' --configfile config/myapp.conf --device Pixel_2_API_30_x86_ >>


=head1 TESTING

The normal tests under C<t/>, initiated with C<make test>,
are quite limited in scope because they do not assume
a connected device. That is, they do not check any
functions which require interaction with a connected
device.

The I<live tests> under C<xt/live>, initiated with
C<make livetest>, require
an Android device connected to your desktop on which
you installed this package and on which you are doing the testing.
This suffices to be an emulator. It can also be a real Android
phone but testing
with your smartphone is not a good idea, please do not do this,
unless it is some phone which you do not store important data.

So, prior to C<make livetest> make sure you have an android
emulator up and running with, for example,
C<emulator -avd Pixel_2_API_30_x86_> . See section
L<Android Emulators> for how to install, list and run them
buggers.

Testing will not send any messages via the device's apps.
E.g. the plugin L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator::Plugins::Apps::Viber>
will not send a message via Viber but it will mock it.

The live tests will sometimes fail because, so far,
something unexpected happened in the device. For example,
in testing sending input text to a text-edit widget,
the calendar will be opened and a new entry will be added
and its text-edit widget will be targeted. Well, sometimes
the calendar app will give you some notification
on startup and this messes up with the focus.
Other times, the OS will detect that some app is taking too
long to launch and pops up a notification about
"I<something is not responding, shall I close it>".
This steals the focus and sometimes it causes
the tests to fail.

=head1 PREREQUISITES

=head2 Android Studio

This is not a prerequisite but it is
highly recommended to install
(from L<https://developer.android.com/studio>)
on your desktop computer because it contains
all the executables you will need,
saved in a well documented file system hierarchy,
which can then be accessed from the command line.

Additionally, Android Studio offers possibly the
easiest way to create Android Virtual Devices (AVD) which emulate
an Android phone of various specifications.
I mention this because one can install apps
on an AVD and control them from your desktop
as long as you are able to receive sms verification
codes from a real phone. This is great for
experimenting without pluggin in your real
smartphone on your desktop.

The bottom line is that by installing Android Studio,
you have all the executables you need for running things
from the command line and, additionally, you have
the easiest way for creating Android
Virtual Devices, which emulate Android devices: phones,
tablets, automotive displays. Once you have this set up, you
will not need to open Android Studio ever again unless you
want to update your kit. All the functionality
will be accessible from the command line.

=head2 ADB

Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is the program
which communicates with your smartphone or
an Android Virtual Device from
your desktop (Linux, osx and the unnamed C<0$>).

If you do not want to install Android Studio, the C<adb> executable
is included in the package called
"Android SDK Platform Tools" available from
the Android official site, here:
L<https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools#downloads>

You will need the C<adb> executable to be on your path
or specify its fullpath in the configuration file
supplied to L<Android::ElectricSheep::Automator>'s constructor.

=head2 USB Debugging

The targeted smartphone must have "USB Debugging" enabled
via the "Developer mode".
This is not
to be confused with 'rooted' or 'jailbroken' modes, none of
these are required for experimenting with the current module.

In order to enable "USB Debugging", you need
to set the smartphone to enter "Developer" mode by
following this procedure:

Go to C<Settings-E<gt>System-E<gt>About Phone>
Tap on C<Build Number> 7 times [sic!].
Enter your phone pin and you are in developer mode.

You can exit Developer Mode by going to
C<Settings-E<gt>System-E<gt>Developer> and turn it off.
It is highly advised to turn off Developer Mode
for everyday use of your phone.
B<Do not connect your smartphone
to public WIFI networks with Developer Mode ON>.

B<Do not leave home with Developer Mode ON>.

Once you have enabled "USB Debugging", you have
two options for making your device visible to
your desktop and, consequently, to ADB and to this module:

=over 4

=item connect your android device via a USB cable
to your desktop computer. I am not sure if you also
need to tap on the USB charging options and allow
"Transfer Files".

=item connect your device to the same WIFI network
as your desktop computer. Then follow instructions
from, e.g., here L<https://developer.android.com>.
This requires a newer Android version.

=back

=head2 Android Emulators

It is possible to do most things your
smartphone does with an Android Virtual Device.
You can install apps on the the virtual device which
you can register by supplying your real smartphone
number.

List all virtual devices currently available
in your desktop computer,  with C<emulator -list-avds>
which outputs something like:

    Pixel_2_API_27_x86_
    Pixel_2_API_30_x86_

Start a virtual device with C<emulator -avd Pixel_2_API_30_x86_>

And hey, you have an android phone running on your
desktop in its own space, able to access the network
but not the telephone network (no SIM card).

It is possible to create a virtual device
from the command line.
But perhaps it is easier if you download Android Studio
from: L<https://developer.android.com/studio> and follow
the setup there using the GUI. You will need to do this just
once for creating the device, you can then uninstall Android Studio.

Android Studio will download all the
required files and will create some Android Virtual
Devices (the "emulators") for you. It will also be easy to
update your stack in the future. Once you have done the above,
you no longer need to run Android Studio except perhaps for
checking for updates and B<all the required executables by this
package will be available from the command line>.

Otherwise, download "Android SDK Platform Tools" available from
the Android official site, here:
L<https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools#downloads>
(this download is mentioned in L<ADB> if you already fetched it).

Fetch the required packages with this command:

C<sdkmanager --sdk_root=/usr/local/android-sdk  "platform-tools" "platforms;android-30" "cmdline-tools;latest" "emulator">

Note that C<sdkmanager --list> will list the latest android versions etc.

Now you should have access to C<avdmanager> executable
(it should be located here: C</usr/local/android-sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/avdmanager>)
which you can use to create an emulator.

List all available android virtual devices you can create: C<avdmanager list target>

List all available devices you can emulate: C<avdmanager list device>

List all available devices you have created already: C<avdmanager list avd>

Create virtual device: C<avdmanager create avd -d "Nexus 6" -n myavd -k "system-images;android-29;google_apis;x86">

See L<https://stackoverflow.com/a/77599934>

=head1 NO ACCESS TO GOOGLE PLAY?

See here if your Android Emulator has no access to Google's App Store:

L<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71815181/how-can-i-get-google-play-to-work-on-android-emulator-in-android-studio-bumblebe>

Your mileage will lean on the low side.

=head1 USING YOUR REAL SMARTPHONE

Using your real smartphone
with such a powerful tool may not be such
a good idea.

One can only imagine what
kind of viruses MICROSOFT WINDOWS can pass on to an
Android device connected to it. Refrain from doing
so unless you are using a more secure OS.

Start with an emulator.

=head1 WILL ANYTHING BE INSTALLED ON THE DEVICE?

Absolutely NOTHING!

This package
B<does not mess with the connected device,
neither it installs anything on it
